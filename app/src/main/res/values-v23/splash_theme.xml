			Splash screens should only be used to display brand identity on cold starts.
			It's faster to set a custom theme on SplashActivity, and set windowBackground to a drawable that contains the app's logo.
			This is much less expensive than calling setContentView().
			This is especially useful, because SplashActivity just proxies to other activities, based on conditions.
