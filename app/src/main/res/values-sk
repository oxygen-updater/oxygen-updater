	<string name="contribute_explanation">Oxygen Updater needs your help! In order to give you the latest updates, we need to get the names of update files. These are present on your phone when a regular update pops up.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nOxygen Updater can automatically submit new update file names to our admins. This will use a small amount of data and may use a bit of your battery. All you need to do is waiting (approximately 15 minutes) before installing official System Updates until you see a confirmation of Oxygen Updater that the file has been successfully submitted. Only the \".Ota\" directory on your phone gets scanned once per 15 minutes. It only checks for a specific name in that particular folder.</string>

Carriers usually lock down the device so that users can\'t update or modify the firmware without permission from the carrier itself. This is a common practice in the USA: the \"Local Upgrade\" option is removed from carrier-exclusive versions of OxygenOS. This option is necessary to install updates by yourself, even if you don\'t use this app. Unfortunately, we can\'t do anything about this, as we\'re technically, and possibly, legally limited. Reach out to us via email or Discord for more clarity.</string>

Email us or join our Discord server if you\'d like to help us, or to get notified when we release a new version of the app that includes support for your device.</string>
