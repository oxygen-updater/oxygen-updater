## Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Oxygen Updater, the largest community-driven OnePlus app.
To help things stay organized, there are some rules that you'll have to follow:

- Make sure your code works on an actual OnePlus device, not just the Android Emulator
- Make sure your code works when you run the app with the "release" profile. This ensures that the ProGuard minification does not break the code. 
(You may need to generate a new keystore and change the password in `build.gradle` for this to work)
- Clearly indicate your changes in the commit message
- Open a PR at github.
